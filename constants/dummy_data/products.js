      "Fredericia's Swoon Lounge armchair invites you to relax and enjoy its soft cushions and beautiful, open shape. The design studio Space Copenhagen aimed at filling the gap between a large lounge chair and a conventional armchair, and they wanted the result to be perfect in public lounge areas as well as private contexts. Released in 2016, the Swoon Lounge armchair is a combination of an organic silhouette, beautiful fabric upholstery and wooden legs. The removable cushions and lightweight structure make Swoon Lounge a comfortable, adaptable and easy-maintenance chair for all types of surroundings.",

      "The Hanging Egg chair is a timeless design classic, created by Nanna and Jørgen Ditzel in 1959. Today, Hanging Egg is part of Sika-Design’s Icons collection that features rattan furniture from some of the most talented designers of the 20th century Hanging Egg is equally inviting in the living room, children's room or veranda. The inviting nest-like chair is woven of golden brown rattan and comes with a comfortable, upholstered seat cushion. Please remember that rattan is a tropical wood species, and therefore holds up best in humid settings. The scorching sun, air conditioning or being too close to a heat source may dry out the rattan furniture, which can lead to tears and breakage. It is also advisable that rattan furniture should not be left outside without fully protecting it from rain and snow, even though it does withstand the cold and fluctuating temperatures.",

The bird can be seen in many photos of the famous designer couple, and it even made its way to a commercial poster of Eames chairs. The original wooden bird was a piece of folk art from the Appalachian Mountains, which Charles and Ray Eames found on their journeys. Manufactured by Vitra, the walnut-brown Eames House Bird is made of lacquered walnut with steel wire legs.",
